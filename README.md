# 🛡️ Cloud Security & DevSecOps Samples

Welcome to my sample project repository!

This space is dedicated to demonstrating hands-on expertise across cloud security, DevSecOps, FinOps, and infrastructure automation—primarily on the AWS platform.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Cloud Security and DevSecOps Specialist with over 15 years of experience in building secure, scalable, and compliant cloud environments. My background combines strong programming skills with deep knowledge of AWS architecture, CI/CD, IaC, compliance standards, and cost optimization practices.

## 🧰 Areas Covered

This repository will include sample implementations across the following domains:

- **Cloud Security**  
  Guardrails, IAM hardening, security monitoring, policy-as-code, and secure workload configurations.

- **DevSecOps Automation**  
  CI/CD pipeline security, SAST/DAST integration, container image scanning, and automated compliance checks.

- **FinOps & Cost Optimization**  
  Automated cost governance, idle resource cleanup, tagging enforcement, and cloud spend analytics.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  Sample modules using Terraform and AWS CloudFormation with embedded security and compliance validations.

- **Incident Response & DR**  
  Runbooks, snapshot strategies, AWS Backup automation, and RTO/RPO planning.


## ✅ Compliance & Standards Referenced

- **ISO 27001**
- **NIST 800-53**
- **CIS AWS Benchmarks**
- **GDPR / HIPAA**

## 📌 Why This Repo?

Security, compliance, and cost-efficiency are not mutually exclusive—they are interconnected pillars of cloud success. These samples aim to demonstrate real-world implementations of that philosophy using automation, secure coding, and continuous governance.
